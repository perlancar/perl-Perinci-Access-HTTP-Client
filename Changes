0.07     2013-04-04  Released-By: SHARYANTO

         [INCOMPATIBLE CHANGES]

         - Adjust to Perinci-Access-HTTP-Server 0.27. The way log messages is
           sent to the client is now different (chunk type is now 'l'/'r' +
           <bytes> + ' ' instead of just 'L'/'R' which is not reliable because
           HTTP chunking is not done 1:1 on different PSGI servers. This client
           is thus incompatible with older server.

         - Instead of passing HTTP auth credentials via \%opts in request(), it
           is now stored in object's attributes, for convenience.

           URL as object attribute.
